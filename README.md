# game-of-goose
This project is a game of goose I did during my master's degree after a few hours of Java SE course. It was our final exam for the Java and we had to conceive and code the game.

First, I will upload my project as it was but my goal is to improve the file structure, the class conception and the code with what I have learnt since I became a developer.
