# Overview

This project is a game of goose I did during my master's degree after a few hours of Java SE course. It was our final exam in Java and we had to conceive and code the game. The rule was to make the game from scratch to see if we understood how to use classes and how to code simple logic in Java.

A console interface displaying the results of the game was enough for our professor but I wanted to push the subject further to see what I could actually do with Swing and AWT. Furthermore I wanted to prepare myself for my future internship during which I knew I would have to use Java to create an application with an interface.
